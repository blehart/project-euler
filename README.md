### What is Project Euler?  
    A series of math problems intended to be solved with programs.


### What I learned...
    When iterating through a loop one hundred billion times, every optimization counts.
    
    Is there an algorithm that will get me the same answer in a fraction of the time?
    Is there potential for integer overflow?  
    Can I avoid the integer overflow without using long or BigInteger?
    Can I narrow down the solution space?
    Which condition should I check first?
